# Overview

This script provides a simple interface around viewing and manipulating project version metadata. It may be used to either bump, set, or view the version information for the project in a given directory. It is written with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) in mind.

It currently does it's best to determine whether the given directory contains a NodeJS, Erlang, Chef Cookbook, or Ansible project before just settling on keeping the version in a file named `version`. If a NodeJS project is discovered then the `package.json` will be edited. If an Ansible project is discovered then no files will be modified but the tags will still be handled. The Erlang detection is limited to OTP apps, and `avakas` will attempt to edit a rebar style `foo.app.src`. If a Chef Cookbook is discovered then `avakas` will attempt to modify the `version` attribute in `metadata.rb`.

The avakas tool makes a few assumptions

* There is only one logical project in each directory.
* The directory is somewhere in a git repository. You can have multiple projects per repository by using the `--tag-prefix` option.
* For the protection of the user the git workspace must not be dirty.

The avakas tool supports the following types of version files

* NodeJS `package.json`
* Erlang/OTP and rebar `foo.app.src`
* Chef Cookbook `metadata.rb`
* Plain ol' `version` file

# Operations

## show

This mode will return the current version for a given project. The following will show the current Public API version. This operation supports an additional `--build` argument, which will cause it to extend the version set in source control with build-time metadata. It also supports the `--pre-build` argument, which does the same thing on top of the prerelease field, because all kinds of package management systems do not actually support the build semantic version component.


```shell
avakas show $HOME/projects/hal9000
```

## set

This mode will set an explicit version. Note that the string must be a valid semantic version.
```shell
avakas set $HOME/projects/hal9000 2.0.0
```

## bump

This mode will automatically update the version based on the input provided. It has four modes of operation.

* `major` will update the major (left) version component.
* `minor` will update the minor (middle) version component.
* `patch` will update the patch (right) version component.
* `pre` will update the prerelase (to the right, separated by a `-`)

## auto

This mode will automatically update the version based on the GIT commit message. It depends on three keywords in commit message.

* `major` keyword in a git commit message will update the major (left) version component.
* `minor` keyword in a git commit message will update the minor (middle) version component.
* `patch` keyword in a git commit message will update the (right) version component.
*  If all the three keywords or possible combinations of any two keywords are present, then it will update the higher priority version component. i.e `major`>`minor`>`patch`.
*  If none of the three keywords are present, version would not be updated.

# Arguments

### `--dry-run`

This will result in nothing being pushed to upstream git sources.

### `--branch`

The branch to use when updating git.

### `--remote`

The remote to push tags and version updates.

### `--tag-prefix`

This prefix will be added to the version string when creating a git tag.

# Docker

You can use `avakas` as a Docker container as well. It supports either static SSH keys or the SSH Agent. It seems like the SSH agent only works on Linux though. The Docker entrypoint should setup your SSH environment on the `set` and `bump` `avakas` actions.

You can map a folder to `/etc/avakas` for static SSH or Git environment configuration. If the file `avakasrc` is present in `/etc/avakas` it will be sourced prior to running `avakas`. A common use case here is to export the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` environment variables.

In all cases, you will want to map a source project into a folder and point `avakas` at it. The following example (running on Linux with SSH Agent forwarding) would bump the patch portion of the version in the current directory.

```
$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/app -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-agent -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent otakup0pe/avakas bump /app patch
```

The next example (running on OSX) would set the version explicitly in the current directory. Note how we need to setup a working folder to map `/etc/avakas` against.

```
$ mkdir -p /tmp/ssh-avakas-working
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/ssh-avakas-working
$ docker run  -v $(pwd):/app -v /tmp/ssh-avakas-working:/etc/avakas otakup0pe/avakas set /app 0.0.1
```
